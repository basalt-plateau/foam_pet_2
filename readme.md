![Foam Pet](vehicles_frontend/sveltenetics/static/pictures/Foam_Pet_0001.svg)

This pet can interact with Aptos with offline trinkets   
like a "laptop", "desktop", etc.   

With one Foam Pet living in an offline machine and another living in an online machine,   
signatures can happen with QR code to bionic eye gestures,   
as long as both machines have a bionic eye + a screen.

A Foam Pet with a Docker Vehicle or a PyPI vehicle   
can be adopted from here.
