![Foam Pet](vehicles_frontend/sveltenetics/static/pictures/Foam_Pet_0001.svg)

A pet on an offline machine (such as a laptop or desktop)  
can interact with https://foam.pet

By doing so, ultra safe Aptos (APT) transactions can happen.  
https://aptosfoundation.org

Both machines need a camera (bionic eye) and screen.  

A pet for a Linux_x86_64 machine or docker     
can be adopted from releases:
